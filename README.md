# Heart Disease Health Indicators.
According to the World Health Organization, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases (heart disease), account for approximately 36% of all deaths in Uganda (World Health Organisation, 2023).In 2021, cardiovascular diseases alone caused about 27,121 deaths, with an age-standardized mortality rate of 223 per 100,000 people (World Health Federation, 2025). These figures underscore the urgent need for robust, data-driven models that can predict heart disease risk and help intervene early in at-risk populations.
